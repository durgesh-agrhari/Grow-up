          <h3>1: What is a Computer Network?</h3><br />
          <p className='pp'>
          A computer network is a collection of interconnected computers and devices that can communicate with each other to share resources, data, and information.<br/> <br/>
           These networks can be categorized based on their geographical coverage, such as Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
          </p><br/>


          <h3>2: Components of a Computer Network:</h3><br />

          <p className='pp'>Nodes: Nodes are devices connected to the network, including computers, servers, routers, switches, printers, etc. <br/><br/>
          Links: Links refer to the physical or wireless connections that facilitate communication between nodes. These connections can be wired (e.g., Ethernet cables) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).<br/><br/>
          Network Devices: Network devices are hardware components that help in transmitting, receiving, and managing data across the network. Examples include routers, switches, hubs, modems, and access points.<br/><br/>
          Protocols: Protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over the network. They ensure compatibility and proper communication between devices.<br/><br/>
          Networking Software: Networking software includes operating system features, network protocols, and applications that enable network communication and resource sharing.<br/><br/>
          Network Topology: Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of the network, including how nodes are connected and the structure of data flow. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid topologies. </p><br/><br/>
          
          <h3>Types of Computer Networks:</h3><br />

          <p className='pp'>Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN covers a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building. It typically uses Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi for connectivity and is often used for sharing resources like printers and files.<br/><br/>
          Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN spans a large geographical area, such as multiple cities, countries, or continents. It connects LANs and other networks over long distances using technologies like leased lines, fiber optics, and satellite links.<br/><br/>
          Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A MAN covers a larger geographical area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city or metropolitan area. It provides high-speed connectivity between multiple LANs and is often used by organizations and educational institutions.<br/><br/>
          Wireless Networks: Wireless networks use radio waves or infrared signals to transmit data without the need for physical cables. Examples include Wi-Fi (Wireless LAN), Bluetooth, and cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G).<br/><br/>
          Internet: The Internet is a global network of networks that connects millions of devices worldwide. It allows users to access information, communicate, and share resources through various services like email, web browsing, and online streaming. </p><br/><br/>
          <h3>Key Concepts in Computer Networking: </h3><br />

          <p className='pp'> IP Addressing: IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are unique numeric identifiers assigned to each device on a network. They enable devices to communicate with each other across the network.<br/><br/>
          Routing: Routing is the process of directing data packets between different networks or nodes to reach their destination. Routers are responsible for making routing decisions based on IP addresses and network topology.<br/><br/>
          Switching: Switching involves the forwarding of data packets within a network from one device to another. Switches are used to create network segments and optimize data transmission.<br/><br/>
          Protocols and Standards: Networking protocols define the rules and conventions for communication between devices. Common protocols include TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, and DNS. Standards organizations like IEEE and IETF develop and maintain these protocols.<br/><br/>
          Network Security: Network security measures protect data and resources from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks. This includes techniques like encryption, firewalls, authentication, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).<br/><br/>
          Overall, computer networks play a crucial role in modern computing by enabling communication and resource sharing across various devices and locations. Understanding the basics of computer networks is essential for professionals working in IT, networking, and related fields. </p><br/><br/>
