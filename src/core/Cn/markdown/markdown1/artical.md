1. **What is the OSI model, and how many layers does it have?** <br/>
   - Answer: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven layers.<br/><br/>

2. **Explain the TCP/IP model and its layers.**<br/>
   - Answer: The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model, consisting of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Link.<br/><br/>

3. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**<br/>
   - Answer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and acknowledgment, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) offers connectionless, unreliable communication without acknowledgment.<br/><br/>

4. **What is an IP address?**<br/>
   - Answer: An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network, enabling communication between devices using the Internet Protocol (IP).<br/><br/>

5. **What is a subnet mask?**<br/>
   - Answer: A subnet mask is used in conjunction with an IP address to divide the IP address into network and host portions. It specifies the network portion of the IP address.<br/><br/>

6. **What is a router, and how does it work?**<br/>
   - Answer: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and uses routing tables to determine the best path for forwarding packets.<br/><br/>

7. **What is a switch, and how does it differ from a hub?**<br/>
   - Answer: A switch is a networking device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and forwards data packets based on MAC addresses. Unlike a hub, a switch creates separate collision domains and does not broadcast data to all connected devices.<br/><br/>

8. **What is ARP, and how does it work?**<br/>
   - Answer: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device, it sends an ARP request to obtain the MAC address corresponding to the destination IP address.<br/><br/>

9. **What is DNS, and what is its purpose?**<br/>
   - Answer: DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system that translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It allows users to access websites using human-readable domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.<br/><br/>

10. **Explain the concept of DHCP.**<br/>
    - Answer: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.<br/><br/>

11. **What is NAT, and why is it used?**<br/>
    - Answer: NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique used to modify network address information in IP packet headers while in transit across a router or firewall. It allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address.<br/><br/>

12. **What is a firewall, and how does it enhance network security?**<br/>
    - Answer: A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, preventing unauthorized access and malicious activities.<br/><br/>

13. **What is VLAN, and why is it used?**<br/>
    - Answer: VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical grouping of devices within a LAN that are configured to communicate as if they were on the same physical network, regardless of their physical location. VLANs enhance network security, reduce broadcast traffic, and facilitate network management and scalability.<br/><br/>

14. **What is a MAC address, and how is it different from an IP address?**<br/>
    - Answer: A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It is hardcoded into the network interface by the manufacturer. Unlike an IP address, a MAC address is used for local network communication and does not change.<br/><br/>

15. **What is a proxy server, and what are its benefits?**<br/>
    - Answer: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, forwarding requests from clients to servers and vice versa. It can improve performance, enhance security, and provide anonymity for users by caching frequently accessed content, filtering web traffic, and masking the client's IP address.<br/><br/>

16. **What is SSL/TLS, and how does it ensure secure communication over the internet?**<br/>
    - Answer: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over a computer network. They provide encryption, authentication, and data integrity to protect sensitive information transmitted between clients and servers, such as web browsers and web servers.<br/><br/>

17. **Explain the concept of QoS (Quality of Service).**<br/>
    - Answer: QoS (Quality of Service) refers to the capability of a network to provide different priority levels to different types of network traffic, ensuring that critical data (e.g., voice or video) receives preferential treatment over less time-sensitive traffic (e.g., email or file transfers). QoS mechanisms prioritize, shape, and control network traffic to meet specific performance requirements.<br/><br/>

18. **What is ICMP, and what is its role in networking?**<br/>
    - Answer: ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network layer protocol used to send error messages and control messages between devices on a network. It is commonly used for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes, such as ping (echo request and reply) and traceroute (route tracing).<br/><br/>

19. **What are the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**<br/>
    - Answer: Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption, whereas asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys. Symmetric encryption is faster but requires secure key distribution, while asymmetric encryption provides better security but is slower.<br/><br/>

20. **What is the purpose of a packet sniffer?**<br/>
    - Answer: A packet sniffer is a tool used to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. It can intercept and decode data packets passing through a network interface, allowing network administrators to monitor network activity, troubleshoot network issues, and detect unauthorized or malicious activities.<br/><br/>
