        <h3>What is Pattern ? </h3><br/>
        
        <p className='pp'>
        In C++, "Pattern" can refer to a specific sequence or arrangement of characters, numbers, or other symbols that follow a particular rule or structure. This concept is often used in various programming tasks, such as text processing, data validation, and image recognition.<br/><br/>

        In C++, patterns can be created using a combination of control structures and string manipulation functions. For example, you can use loops to iterate over a string and check if it matches a particular pattern using conditional statements. You can also use regular expressions to define more complex patterns and perform pattern matching operations on strings.<br/><br/>

        Overall, patterns are an important concept in C++ programming that can help you solve a wide range of problems, from simple string manipulation tasks to more advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks.

        <h3>Advantages of Pattern: </h3><br/>
        <p className='pp'>
        There are several advantages of using patterns in C++ programming:<br/><br/>

        1: Improved code readability: Using patterns can make your code more readable and easier to understand, especially when working with complex data structures or algorithms. Patterns can provide a clear structure and organization to your code, making it easier to follow and modify in the future.<br/><br/>

        2: Faster development time: Patterns can help you write code more quickly and efficiently by providing a set of pre-defined solutions to common programming problems. This can save you time and effort when developing new applications or features.<br/><br/>

        3: Reusability: Patterns are reusable solutions that can be applied to different programming scenarios. This means that once you have created a pattern, you can use it in multiple projects or applications, which can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run.<br/><br/>

        4: Maintainability: By using patterns, you can create more modular and maintainable code, which is easier to debug and modify. This can help you reduce the time and effort required to maintain and update your codebase.<br/><br/>

        5: Scalability: Patterns can help you create scalable and extensible code, which can be easily adapted to new requirements or changes in the environment. This can help you future-proof your code and ensure that it remains relevant and useful over time.<br/><br/>

        Overall, using patterns in C++ programming can provide a wide range of benefits, from improved code readability and faster development time to better maintainability, scalability, and reusability.
