        <h3>What is Stack ? </h3><br/>
        
        <p className='pp'>
          
        In C++, a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) that represents a collection of elements arranged in a specific way. The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
        <br/><br/>
        In programming, a stack is typically implemented as an array or a linked list, and it has two main operations: push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the pop operation removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.

        <h3> Syntax </h3><br/>
        <p className='ppp'>
        std::stack &lt; dataType 	&gt; stackName; <br/>

        std::stack &lt; dataType, containerType &lt; p &gt;&gt; stackName;
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Stacks</h3>
        <p className='ppp'>
        <p className='bb'>.empty()</p><br/>
        Returns true if the stack has no elements.<br/>
        <p className='bb'>.pop()</p><br/>
        Removes the last item added to the top of the stack.<br/>
        <p className='bb'>.push()</p><br/>
        Adds an element to the top of the stack.<br/>
        <p className='bb'>.size()</p><br/>
        Returns the number of elements in the stack.<br/>
        <p className='bb'>.top()</p><br/>
        Returns the element on the top of the stack.<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h3>Type of Stack</h3><br/>

        <p className='pp'>
        In general, there are two main types of stack data structures:<br/><br/>

        Static Stack: In a static stack, the size of the stack is fixed at the time of creation, and it cannot be changed dynamically during runtime. The underlying implementation of a static stack is usually an array, and it has a fixed maximum capacity. If you try to push an element onto a full static stack, it will result in a stack overflow error.<br/><br/>

        Dynamic Stack: In a dynamic stack, the size of the stack can be changed dynamically during runtime as needed. The underlying implementation of a dynamic stack is typically a linked list, and it can grow or shrink as new elements are added or removed. Dynamic stacks are more flexible than static stacks but may have a higher overhead due to the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation required.<br/><br/>

        Additionally, there are also specialized types of stacks, such as:<br/><br/>

        Priority Stack: In a priority stack, each element has a priority associated with it, and the elements are arranged in the stack in order of priority. The top element of the stack is the one with the highest priority.<br/><br/>

        Circular Stack: In a circular stack, the last element of the stack is connected to the first element, forming a circular structure. When the stack is full, the push operation will overwrite the oldest element in the stack, which is at the bottom, instead of causing a stack overflow error. This makes a circular stack useful in scenarios where a fixed-size buffer is required.<br/><br/>
        </p><br/><br/>
        
        <h3>complexity of stack in c++</h3><br/>
        <p>
        The time complexity of the stack container in C++ depends on the operation being performed. Here are the time complexities of some common stack operations:<br/><br/>

        <p className='bb1'> <b>push(): O(1)</b></p> - The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, and since the underlying implementation is a dynamic array or linked list, it has a constant time complexity.<br/><br/>

        <p className='bb1'><b>pop(): O(1)</b> </p>- The pop operation removes the element at the top of the stack, and since the underlying implementation is a dynamic array or linked list, it has a constant time complexity.<br/><br/>

        <p className='bb1'><b>top(): O(1)</b> </p>- The top operation returns a reference to the element at the top of the stack, and since the underlying implementation is a dynamic array or linked list, it has a constant time complexity.<br/><br/>

        <p className='bb1'><b>size(): O(1) </b></p>- The size operation returns the number of elements in the stack, and since the stack container keeps track of the size internally, it has a constant time complexity.<br/><br/>

        <p className='bb1'><b>empty(): O(1) </b></p>- The empty operation checks if the stack is empty, and since the stack container keeps track of the size internally, it has a constant time complexity.<br/><br/>
