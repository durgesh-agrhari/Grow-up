        <h3>1: What is web development</h3><br/>
        
        <p className='pp'>
          Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web 
          applications that are accessible over the internet. It encompasses a wide 
          range of tasks and disciplines to build and manage websites, from the design 
          and user interface to the back-end server and database management. Web 
          development involves both front-end and back-end development, as well as 
          other specialized areas. Here are the key components of web development:
        </p> <br/>

        <ol>
          <li>Front-end Development: Front-end development is concerned with the user interface and user experience of a website. It involves creating the visual elements of a website that users interact with directly. Technologies commonly used for front-end development include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers ensure that websites are responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.</li>
          <li>Back-end Development: Back-end development deals with the server-side of web applications. Back-end developers work with server technologies, databases, and application logic. Common programming languages for back-end development include Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js. They handle data storage, user authentication, and the overall functionality of the website or web application.</li>
          <li>Full-Stack Development: Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development. They can work on the entire web development stack, from the user interface to the server and database. Full-stack developers are often responsible for the end-to-end development of a web project.</li>
          <li>Web Design: Web design focuses on the visual aspects of a website, including layout, typography, colors, and graphics. Web designers create the look and feel of a website, ensuring it is visually engaging and aligns with the brand's identity.</li>
          <li>User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design: UX designers focus on enhancing the overall user experience by improving usability and accessibility. UI designers work on the specific interface elements, such as buttons, forms, and navigation menus, to ensure they are intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
          <li>Web Accessibility: Web accessibility is the practice of making websites usable by people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that websites are navigable by screen readers, have keyboard accessibility, and provide alternative text for images, among other considerations.</li>
