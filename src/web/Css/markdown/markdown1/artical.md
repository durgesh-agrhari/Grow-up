CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to define the presentation of HTML and XML documents, including colors, layouts, and fonts. CSS separates the content of a web page from its visual representation, allowing web developers to control the appearance of multiple web pages from a single style sheet. <br/> <br/>

Here are some basic questions about CSS:<br/> <br/>

1. **What is the purpose of CSS?**<br/> <br/>
   CSS is used to style the presentation of HTML and XML documents. It allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page, ensuring a consistent and attractive appearance across different devices and screen sizes.<br/> <br/>

2. **How is CSS applied to HTML documents?**<br/> <br/>
   CSS can be applied to HTML documents in three ways: inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets. Inline styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. Internal styles are placed within a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. External stylesheets are separate CSS files linked to HTML documents using the `<link>` element.

3. **What are selectors in CSS?**<br/> <br/>
   Selectors are patterns used to select the elements on an HTML page that you want to style. CSS selectors can target elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or their relationship with other elements in the document.<br/> <br/>

4. **What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?**<br/> <br/>
   Classes and IDs are both used to apply styles to HTML elements, but they have different purposes and usage. Classes can be applied to multiple elements on a page and are used to style groups of elements that share common characteristics. IDs, on the other hand, are unique identifiers for individual elements and should only be applied to a single element on a page.<br/> <br/>

5. **What is the box model in CSS?**<br/> <br/>
   The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin. The content area is where the actual content of the element is displayed. Padding is the space between the content and the element's border. The border surrounds the padding and content. Margin is the space outside the border, which creates space between elements.<br/> <br/>

6. **What are CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?**<br/> <br/>
   Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are keywords that can be added to selectors to style elements based on their state or position in the document. Pseudo-classes are used to style elements in specific states, such as `:hover` for styling links when the mouse is over them. Pseudo-elements, denoted by double colons (::), are used to style specific parts of an element's content, such as `::before` to insert content before an element.<br/> <br/>
