HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure and layout of content on a web page by using a variety of tags and attributes. <br/><br/>

Here are some basic questions about HTML:<br/><br/>

1. **What is an HTML tag?**<br/><br/>
   An HTML tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that specifies how a certain element should be formatted or displayed on a web page. Tags are used to define the structure and content of the page.<br/><br/>

2. **What is the basic structure of an HTML document?**<br/><br/>
   An HTML document typically consists of an opening `<html>` tag followed by a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section. The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document, such as its title and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts. The `<body>` section contains the main content of the page.<br/><br/>

3. **What is the purpose of the `<head>` section in an HTML document?**<br/><br/>
   The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document, such as the title of the page, links to external stylesheets and scripts, and other important information that is not directly visible on the page but is necessary for its proper rendering and functionality.<br/><br/>

4. **What is the purpose of the `<body>` section in an HTML document?**<br/><br/>
   The `<body>` section contains the main content of the web page, including text, images, videos, and other elements that are visible to the user when they view the page in a web browser.<br/><br/>

5. **What is an HTML attribute?**<br/><br/>
   An HTML attribute provides additional information about an HTML element and is always specified in the opening tag of the element. Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element and are written as name-value pairs within the element's opening tag.<br/><br/>

6. **What is the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML?**<br/><br/>
   Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available, while inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Block-level elements are used for larger structures like paragraphs or divs, while inline elements are used for smaller elements like spans or links.<br/><br/>

7. **What is the purpose of HTML comments?**<br/><br/>
   HTML comments are used to add notes or reminders within the HTML code that are not displayed on the web page. They are often used to document the code or temporarily disable certain sections for debugging purposes.<br/><br/>
